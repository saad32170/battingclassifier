## 📁 **File Organization**

### **01_original_classifier.py**
- **Status**: ❌ Failed
- **Accuracy**: ~25% (stuck predicting one class)
- **Issues**: Double preprocessing, over-aggressive augmentation
- **Purpose**: Initial baseline model
- **Key Problems**: 
  - Images processed twice in pipeline
  - Too much data augmentation noise
  - Poor architecture design

### **02_working_classifier.py** 
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Accuracy**: 88.00%
- **Purpose**: First successful model after fixing issues
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Single preprocessing pipeline
  - Conservative data augmentation
  - Simple but effective CNN architecture
- **Architecture**: 3 Conv blocks + 2 Dense layers

### **03_advanced_classifier.py**
- **Status**: ✅ Improved
- **Accuracy**: 91.64%
- **Purpose**: Enhanced version with better architecture
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Batch Normalization layers
  - Deeper network (4 Conv blocks)
  - Additional dense layer
  - Better regularization
- **Architecture**: 4 Conv blocks + 3 Dense layers + BatchNorm

### **04_ensemble_classifier.py**
- **Status**: ✅ Ensemble Training
- **Purpose**: Training script for ensemble of 3 models
- **Models Trained**:
  - Custom CNN with diverse augmentation
  - ResNet50V2 (transfer learning)
  - EfficientNetB0 (transfer learning)
- **Result**: Individual models achieved 90.90%, 95.24%, and similar accuracies

### **05_no_augmentation_classifier.py**
- **Status**: ❌ Poor Performance
- **Purpose**: Test model without data augmentation
- **Result**: Lower accuracy due to overfitting
- **Lesson**: Data augmentation is crucial for generalization

## 🎯 **Key Learnings**

### **What Didn't Work:**
1. **Double preprocessing** - caused data corruption
2. **Over-aggressive augmentation** - too much noise
3. **No augmentation** - led to overfitting
4. **Simple architecture** - insufficient capacity

### **What Worked:**
1. **Single preprocessing pipeline** - clean data flow
2. **Conservative augmentation** - balanced variety
3. **Batch Normalization** - stable training
4. **Transfer learning** - pre-trained features
5. **Ensemble methods** - combined strengths
